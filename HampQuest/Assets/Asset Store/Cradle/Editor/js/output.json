The majority of the buildings were not modeled for HampQuest. They were amade for another Div 3 by Fletcher West who had a simmilar vision of making a virtual campus. The Kern model file was distributed to us by Bruner/Cott Architects. This virtual campus is and will be a construction assembled by many people and hopefully HampQuest can be a platform for continuing work on this idea of a virtual campus space. \n[[Back|Text 4]] ",
